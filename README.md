# VoraciousEBookReader -- a new kind of EBook reader

The Voraction EBook Reader -- available on the Windows Store for free with no ads -- is designed by a lover of project Gutenberg! 

# Three things that make Voraction EBook Reader better

## It knows about the Project Gutenberg catalog

The Voractious EBook reader comes with a snapshot of the Gutenberg catalog; you can update at any time (sorry, updates are very slow :-( ). You can quickly search for Gutenberg books from their author, title, and subject (looking for an escape? you can find all books with a subject that includes "castaways"!). Because the catalog is local, searches are fast (sorry, except sometimes the first search which on some machines can take 10 seconds).

And Voractious EBook Reader knows that downloading a Gutenberg book should be simple and quick. Just right-swipe to download, and then right-swipe again to read!

## Two-side reader: images + contents

The Voracious EBook reader is designed to support two "panes". One is for reading. The other? You can easily see the book table of contents (which is kept in sync with you as you read), or the book images (reading a mystery with a sketch-map of the crime scene? You can see a *zoomable* map on one pane and read the book on the other pane!). Other reader tools include instant search of highlighted text: when the research pane is up, anything you highlight in the book will be instantly searched on Bing.

## Lots of books? Yes!

Voractious EBook reader has three search tabs: 
- search for books you haven't downloaded yet
- search for books you've downloaded but haven't started reading
- search for books you are currently reading

The status of each book -- including 'star' ratings and reviews and if you're done -- can sync (via OneDrive) from one computer to the next!
